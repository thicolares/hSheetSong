Sheet songs (song lyrics with chords attached) are published in a fixed structure and without any semantics (where there are, just the chords, and even then, without any pattern).

As a consequence, it is impossible to predict how the text will fit today different screen sizes intelligently, avoiding blanks and scrollbar (regarding smartphones, notebooks, tablets and even TVs).


Publication of audio speeches on blogs is often called "podcasting". In essence though, it is simply audio speech publishing. Quotes of audio files are beginning to appear, and publishers are putting up files with links to other audio files they've quoted from. Most audio appears to often have the same base elements as video and photos, with the exception of quotes.

I want to propose a microformat to easily structure chords, verses, choruses, considering concepts such as prosody, common popular songs scrutcures etc. So will be easy to 
 In the near future, I can even build a online editor etc.

A user who plays an instrument while reading the song sheet, preferably uses no hands. At most, one. Autoscroll tools are not enought for me, I never use. Moreover, it turns a tragedy on the phone or tablet.

I'm aware of existent formats, like Chordpro (http://onsongapp.com/manual/index.php?ID=167). And projects like Chordii (http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/) or OnSong (http://onsongapp.com/). But they seems not disruptive metaphor of what already exists: paper printed sheet songs with fixed structure.

Finaly, I'm studying for my master's degree (interested in UX, usability and user-centedered software development studies). It will be great to work with something like that.

Reviews and contributions are welcome. I'm writing an example to support my proposal. Critiques are also welcome, not afraid of being wrong, so is science. :)
