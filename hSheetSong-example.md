### hSheetSong Example


Sheet songs (song lyrics with chords attached) are published in a fixed structure and without any semantics (where there are, just the chords, and even then, without any pattern). As a consequence, it is impossible to predict how the text will fit today different screen sizes intelligently, avoiding blanks and scrollbar (regarding smartphones, notebooks, tablets and even TVs).
