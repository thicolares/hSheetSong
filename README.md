*Sheet songs microformat proposal sent to  microformats-new@microformats.org at Sun 07, 2013*

#### Problem

Sheet songs (song lyrics with chords attached) are published in a fixed structure and without any semantics (where there are, just the chords, and even then, without any pattern).

As a consequence, it is impossible to predict how the text will fit today different screen sizes intelligently, avoiding blanks and scrollbar (regarding smartphones, notebooks, tablets and even TVs).

#### Solution

I want to propose a microformat to easily structure chords, verses, choruses, considering concepts about sheets song structuring (such as prosody, common popular songs scrutcures etc.). So will be easy to reorganize the context given different screen sizes. In the near future, I can even build tools to support it, like an online editor etc.

A user who plays an instrument while reading the song sheet, preferably uses no hands. At most, one. Autoscroll tools are not enought for me, I never use them. Moreover, it turns into a tragedy on the phone or tablet.

#### Notes

I'm aware of some existent formats, like [Chordpro](http://tenbyten.com/software/songsgen/help/HtmlHelp/files_reference.htm), and projects like [Chordii](http://www.vromans.org/johan/projects/Chordii/) or [OnSong](http://onsongapp.com/). But they seem not to disruptive metaphor of what already exists: paper printed sheet songs with fixed structure.

Finaly, I'm studying for my master's degree (interested in user experience, usability and user-centedered software development studies). It will be great to work with something like that.

#### Reviews is encouraged :)

Reviews and contributions are welcome. I'm writing an example to support my proposal. Critiques are also welcome! I'm not afraid of being wrong, this is Science, isn't? :)
